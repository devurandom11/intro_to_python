# Project 3c
# Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the
# computerâ€™s disk. Write a program that calculates the average of all the numbers stored in
# the file. Add exception handling to the program for ValueError,

# Define main function
def main():
    # Introduce user to script
    intro()
    # Read the file
    total, count = read_file()
    
    # Print results if no errors occured in the read_file() function.

# Introduce user to script and pause for effect.
def intro():
    print('\nWelcome to the Average Numeber Calculator.\n\nThis app will calculate the average of all the numbers stored in the file \'numbers.txt\'\n')
